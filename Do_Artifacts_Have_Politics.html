        No idea is more provocative in controversies about technology and
        society than the notion that technical things have political qualities.
        At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of
        modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their
        contributions to efficiency and productivity and their positive and
        negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they
        can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this
        kind are a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the
        meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.
      </p>

        Writing in the early 1960s, Lewis Mumford gave classic statement to one
        version of the theme, arguing that &quot;from late neolithic times in
        the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have
        recurrently existed side by side: one authoritarian, the other
        democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but
        inherently unstable, the other man- centered, relatively weak, but
        resourceful and durable.&quot;<sup

        This thesis stands at the heart of Mumford's studies of the city,
        architecture, and history of technics, and mirrors concerns voiced
        earlier in the works of Peter Kropotkin, William Morris, and other
        nineteenth-century critics of industrialism. During the 1970s,
        antinuclear and pro-solar energy movements in Europe and the United
        States adopted a similar notion as the centerpiece of their arguments.
        According to environmentalist Denis Hayes, &quot;The increased
        deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward
        authoritarianism. Indeed, safe reliance upon nuclear power as the
        principal source of energy may be possible only in a totalitarian
        state.&quot; Echoing the views of many proponents of appropriate
        technology and the soft energy path, Hayes contends that &quot;dispersed
        solar sources are more compatible than centralized technologies with
        social equity, freedom and cultural pluralism.&quot;

        An eagerness to interpret technical artifacts in political language is
        by no means the exclusive property of critics of large- scale,
        high-technology systems. A long lineage of boosters has insisted that
        the biggest and best that science and industry made available were the
        best guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The factory system, automobile, telephone, radio, television, space
        program, and of course nuclear power have all at one time or another
        been described as democratizing, liberating forces. David Lillienthal's
        <em>TVA:</em> Democracy on the March, for example, found this promise in
        the phosphate fertilizers and electricity that technical progress was
        bringing to rural Americans during the 1940s.

        Three decades later Daniel Boorstin's The Republic of Technology
        extolled television for &quot;its power to disband armies, to cashier
        presidents, to create a whole new democratic world.

        Scarcely a new invention comes along that someone doesn't proclaim it as
        the salvation of a free society.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is no surprise to learn that technical systems of various kinds are
        deeply interwoven in the conditions of modern politics. The physical
        arrangements of industrial production, warfare, communications, and the
        like have fundamentally changed the exercise of power and the experience
        of citizenship. But to go beyond this obvious fact and to argue that
        certain technologies <em>in themselves</em> have political properties
        seems, at first glance, completely mistaken. We all know that people
        have politics; things do not. To discover either virtues or evils in
        aggregates of steel, plastic, transistors, integrated circuits,
        chemicals, and the like seems just plain wrong, a way of mystifying
        human artifice and of avoiding the true sources, the human sources of
        freedom and oppression, justice and injustice. Blaming the hardware
        appears even more foolish than blaming the victims when it comes to
        judging conditions of public life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, the stern advice commonly given those who flirt with the notion
        that technical artifacts have political qualities: What matters is not
        technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is
        embedded. This maxim, which in a number of variations is the central
        premise of a theory that can be called the social determination of
        technology, has an obvious wisdom. It serves as a needed corrective to
        those who focus uncritically upon such things as &quot;the computer and
        its social impacts&quot; but who fail to look behind technical devices
        to see the social circumstances of their development, deployment, and
        use. This view provides an antidote to naive technological
        determinism–the idea that technology develops as the sole result of an
        internal dynamic and then, unmediated by any other influence, molds
        society to fit its patterns. Those who have not recognized the ways in
        which technologies are shaped by social and economic forces have not
        gotten very far.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the corrective has its own shortcomings; taken literally, it
        suggests that technical <em>things</em> do not matter at all. Once one
        has done the detective work necessary to reveal the social origins–
        power holders behind a particular instance of technological change–one
        will have explained everything of importance. This conclusion offers
        comfort to social scientists. It validates what they had always
        suspected, namely, that there is nothing distinctive about the study of
        technology in the first place. Hence, they can return to their standard
        models of social power– those of interest-group politics, bureaucratic
        politics, Marxist models of class struggle, and the like–and have
        everything they need. The social determination of technology is, in this
        view, essentially no different from the social determination of, say,
        welfare policy or taxation.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are, however, good reasons to believe that technology is
        politically significant in its own right, good reasons why the standard
        models of social science only go so far in accounting for what is most
        interesting and troublesome about the subject. Much of modern social and
        political thought contains recurring statements of what can be called a
        theory of technological politics, an odd mongrel of notions often
        crossbred with orthodox liberal, conservative, and socialist
        philosophies.

        The theory of technological politics draws attention to the momentum of
        large-scale sociotechnical systems, to the response of modern societies
        to certain technological imperatives, and to the ways human ends are
        powerfully transformed as they are adapted to technical means. This
        perspective offers a novel framework of interpretation and explanation
        for some of the more puzzling patterns that have taken shape in and
        around the growth of modern material culture. Its starting point is a
        decision to take technical artifacts seriously. Rather than insist that
        we immediately reduce everything to the interplay of social forces, the
        theory of technological politics suggests that we pay attention to the
        characteristics of technical objects and the meaning of those
        characteristics. A necessary complement to, rather than a replacement
        for, theories of the social determination of technology, this approach
        identifies certain technologies as political phenomena in their own
        right. It points us back, to borrow Edmund Husserl's philosophical
        injunction, to the things themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        In what follows I will outline and illustrate two ways in which
        artifacts can contain political properties. First are instances in which
        the invention, design, or arrangement of a specific technical device or
        system becomes a way of settling an issue in the affairs of a particular
        community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seen in the proper light, examples of this kind are fairly
        straightforward and easily under stood. Second are cases of what can be
        called &quot;inherently political technologies,&quot; man-made systems
        that appear to require or to be strongly compatible with particular
        kinds of political relationships. Arguments about cases of this kind are
        much more troublesome and closer to the heart of the matter. By the term
        &quot;politics&quot; I mean arrangements of power and authority in human
        associations as well as the activities that take place within those
        arrangements. For my purposes here, the term &quot;technology&quot; is
        understood to mean all of modern practical artifice, but to avoid
        confusion I prefer to speak of &quot;technologies&quot; plural, smaller
        or larger pieces or systems of hardware of a specific kind.

        My intention is not to settle any of the issues here once and for all,
        but to indicate their general dimensions and significance.

      <h2>Technical Arrangements And Social Order</h2>

      <p>
        ANYONE WHO has traveled the highways of America and has gotten used to
        the normal height of overpasses may well find something a little odd
        about some of the bridges over the park ways on Long Island, New York.
        Many of the overpasses are extraordinarily low, having as little as nine
        feet of clearance at the curb. Even those who happened to notice this
        structural peculiarity would not be inclined to attach any special
        meaning to it. In our accustomed way of looking at things such as roads
        and bridges, we see the details of form as innocuous and seldom give
        them a second thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        It turns out, however, that some two hundred or so lowhanging overpasses
        on Long Island are there for a reason. They were deliberately designed
        and built that way by someone who wanted to achieve a particular social
        effect. Robert Moses, the master builder of roads, parks, bridges, and
        other public works of the 1920s to the 1970s in New York, built his
        overpasses ac cording to specifications that would discourage the
        presence of buses on his parkways. According to evidence provided by
        Moses' biographer, Robert A. Caro, the reasons reflect Moses social
        class bias and racial prejudice. Automobile-owning whites of
        &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;comfortable middle&quot; classes, as he
        called them, would be free to use the parkways for recreation and
        commuting. Poor people and blacks, who normally used public transit,
        were kept off the roads because the twelve-foot tall buses could not
        handle the overpasses. One consequence was to limit access of racial
        minorities and low-income groups to Jones Beach, Moses' widely acclaimed
        public park. Moses made doubly sure of this result by vetoing a proposed
        extension of the Long Island Railroad to Jones Beach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Robert Moses' life is a fascinating story in recent U. S. political
        history. His dealings with mayors, governors, and presidents; his
        careful manipulation of legislatures, banks, labor unions, the press,
        and public opinion could be studied by political scientists for years.
        But the most important and enduring results of his work are his
        technologies, the vast engineering projects that give New York much of
        its present form. For generations after Moses' death and the alliances
        he forged have fallen apart, his public works, especially the highways
        and bridges he built to favor the use of the automobile over the
        development of mass transit, will continue to shape that city. Many of
        his monumental structures of concrete and steel embody a systematic
        social inequality, a way of engineering relationships among people that,
        after a time, became just another part of the landscape. As New York
        planner Lee Koppleman told Caro about the low bridges on Wantagh
        Parkway, &quot;The old son of a gun had made sure that buses would
        <em>never</em> be able to use his goddamned parkways.&quot;<sup

      <p>
        Histories of architecture, city planning, and public works contain many
        examples of physical arrangements with explicit or implicit political
        purposes. One can point to Baron Haussmann's broad Parisian
        thoroughfares, engineered at Louis Napoleon's direction to prevent any
        recurrence of street fighting of the kind that took place during the
        revolution of 1848. Or one can visit any number of grotesque concrete
        buildings and huge plazas constructed on university campuses in the
        United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s to defuse student
        demonstrations. Studies of industrial machines and instruments also turn
        up interesting political stories, including some that violate our normal
        expectations about why technological innovations are made in the first
        place. If we suppose that new technologies are introduced to achieve
        increased efficiency, the history of technology shows that we will
        sometimes be disappointed. Technological change expresses a panoply of
        human motives, not the least of which is the desire of some to have
        dominion over others even though it may require an occasional sacrifice
        of cost savings and some violation of the normal standard of trying to
        get more from less.
      </p>

      <p>
        One poignant illustration can be found in the history of
        nineteenth-century industrial mechanization. At Cyrus McCormick's reaper
        manufacturing plant in Chicago in the middle 1880s, pneumatic molding
        machines, a new and largely untested innovation, were added to the
        foundry at an estimated cost of $500,000. The standard economic
        interpretation would lead us to expect that this step was taken to
        modernize the plant and achieve the kind of efficiencies that
        mechanization brings. But historian Robert Ozanne has put the
        development in a broader context. At the time, Cyrus McCormick II was
        engaged in a battle with the National Union of Iron Molders. He saw the
        addition of the new machines as a way to 'weed out the bad element among
        the men,&quot; namely, the skilled workers who had organized the union
        local in Chicago.
        <sup
          ><a
            href="#fn8-8989"
            id="fnr8-8989"

            >8</a
          ></sup
        >
        The new machines, manned by unskilled laborers, actually produced
        inferior castings at a higher cost than the earlier process. After three
        years of use the machines were, in fact, abandoned, but by that time
        they had served their purpose–the destruction of the union. Thus, the
        story of these technical developments at the McCormick factory cannot be
        adequately understood outside the record of workers' attempts to
        organize, police repression of the labor movement in Chicago during that
        period, and the events surrounding the bombing at Haymarket Square.
        Technological history and U.S. political history were at that moment
        deeply intertwined.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the examples of Moses' low bridges and McCormick's molding machines,
        one sees the importance of technical arrangements that precede the
        <em>use</em> of the things in question. It is obvious that technologies
        can be used in ways that enhance the power, authority, and privilege of
        some over others, for example, the use of television to sell a
        candidate. In our accustomed way of thinking technologies are seen as
        neutral tools that can be used well or poorly, for good, evil, or
        something in between. But we usually do not stop to inquire whether a
        given device might have been designed and built in such a way that it
        produces a set of consequences logically and temporally
        <em>prior to any of its professed uses.</em> Robert Moses' bridges,
        after all, were used to carry automobiles from one point to another;
        McCormick's machines were used to make metal castings; both
        technologies, however, encompassed purposes far beyond their immediate
        use. If our moral and political language for evaluating technology
        includes only categories having to do with tools and uses, if it does
        not include attention to the meaning of the de signs and arrangements of
        our artifacts, then we will be blinded to much that is intellectually
        and practically crucial.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the point is most easily understood in the light of particular
        intentions embodied in physical form, I have so far offered
        illustrations that seem almost conspiratorial. But to recognize the
        political dimensions in the shapes of technology does not require that
        we look for conscious conspiracies or malicious intentions. The
        organized movement of handicapped people in the United States during the
        1970s pointed out the countless ways in which machines, instruments, and
        structures of common use–buses, buildings, sidewalks, plumbing fixtures,
        and so forth–made it impossible for many handicapped persons to move
        freely about, a condition that systematically excluded them from public
        life. It is safe to say that designs unsuited for the handicapped arose
        more from long-standing neglect than from anyone's active intention. But
        once the issue was brought to public attention, it became evident that
        justice required a remedy. A whole range of artifacts have been
        redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate this minority.
      </p>

      <p>
        Indeed, many of the most important examples of technologies that have
        political consequences are those that transcend the simple categories
        &quot;intended&quot; and &quot;unintended&quot; altogether. These are
        instances in which the very process of technical development is so
        thoroughly biased in a particular direction that it regularly produces
        results heralded as wonderful breakthroughs by some social interests and
        crushing setbacks by others. In such cases it is neither correct nor
        insightful to say, &quot;Someone intended to do somebody else
        harm.&quot; Rather one must say that the technological deck has been
        stacked in advance to favor certain social interests and that some
        people were bound to receive a better hand than others.

        The mechanical tomato harvester, a remarkable device perfected by
        researchers at the University of California from the late 1940s to the
        present offers an illustrative tale. The machine is able to harvest
        tomatoes in a single pass through a row, cutting the plants from the
        ground, shaking the fruit loose, and (in the newest models) sorting the
        tomatoes electronically into large plastic gondolas that hold up to
        twenty-five tons of produce headed for canning factories. To accommodate
        the rough motion of these harvesters in the field, agricultural
        researchers have bred new varieties of tomatoes that are hardier,
        sturdier, and less tasty than those previously grown. The harvesters
        replace the system of handpicking in which crews of farm workers would
        pass through the fields three or four times, putting ripe tomatoes in
        lug boxes and saving immature fruit for later harvest.

        Studies in California indicate that the use of the machine reduces costs
        by approximately five to seven dollars per ton as compared to hand
        harvesting.

        But the benefits are by no means equally divided in the agricultural
        economy. In fact, the machine in the garden has in this instance been
        the occasion for a thorough re shaping of social relationships involved
        in tomato production in rural California.
      </p>

      <p>
        By virtue of their very size and cost of more than $50,000 each, the
        machines are compatible only with a highly concentrated form of tomato
        growing. With the introduction of this new method of harvesting, the
        number of tomato growers declined from approximately 4,000 in the early
        1960s to about 600 in 1973, and yet there was a substantial increase in
        tons of tomatoes produced. By the late 1970s an estimated 32,000 jobs in
        the tomato industry had been eliminated as a direct consequence of
        mechanization.

        Thus, a jump in productivity to the benefit of very large growers has
        occurred at the sacrifice of other rural agricultural communities.

        The University of California's research on and development of
        agricultural machines such as the tomato harvester eventually became the
        subject of a lawsuit filed by attorneys for California Rural Legal
        Assistance, an organization representing a group of farm workers and
        other interested parties. The suit charged that university officials are
        spending tax monies on projects that benefit a handful of private
        interests to the detriment of farm workers, small farmers, consumers,
        and rural California generally and asks for a court injunction to stop
        the practice. The university denied these charges, arguing that to
        accept them &quot;would require elimination of all research with any
        potential practical application.&quot;

        As far as I know, no one argued that the development of the tomato
        harvester was the result of a plot. Two students of the controversy,
        William Friedland and Amy Barton, specifically exonerate the original
        developers of the machine and the hard tomato from any desire to
        facilitate economic concentration in that industry.

        What we see here instead is an ongoing social process in which
        scientific knowledge, technological invention, and corporate profit
        reinforce each other in deeply entrenched patterns, patterns that bear
        the unmistakable stamp of political and economic power. Over many
        decades agricultural research and development in U.S. land-grant
        colleges and universities has tended to favor the interests of large
        agribusiness concerns.

        It is in the face of such subtly ingrained patterns that opponents of
        innovations such as the tomato harvester are made to seem
        &quot;antitechnology&quot; or &quot;antiprogress.&quot; For the
        harvester is not merely the symbol of a social order that rewards some
        while punishing others; it is in a true sense an embodiment of that
        order.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within a given category of technological change there are, roughly
        speaking, two kinds of choices that can affect the relative distribution
        of power, authority, and privilege in a community. Often the crucial
        decision is a simple &quot;yes or no&quot; choice–are we going to
        develop and adopt the thing or not? In recent years many local,
        national, and international disputes about technology have centered on
        &quot;yes or no&quot; judgments about such things as food additives,
        pesticides, the building of highways, nuclear reactors, dam projects,
        and proposed high-tech weapons. The fundamental choice about an
        antiballistic missile or supersonic transport is whether or not the
        thing is going to join society as a piece of its operating equipment.
        Reasons given for and against are frequently as important as those
        concerning the adoption of an important new law.
      </p>

      <p>
        A second range of choices, equally critical in many instances, has to do
        with specific features in the design or arrangement of a technical
        system after the decision to go ahead with it has already been made.
        Even after a utility company wins permission to build a large electric
        power line, important controversies can remain with respect to the
        placement of its route and the design of its towers; even after an
        organization has decided to institute a system of computers,
        controversies can still arise with regard to the kinds of components,
        programs, modes of access, and other specific features the system will
        include. Once the mechanical tomato harvester had been developed in its
        basic form, a design alteration of critical social significance–the
        addition of electronic sorters, for example–changed the character of the
        machine's effects upon the balance of wealth and power in California
        agriculture. Some of the most interesting research on technology and
        politics at present focuses upon the attempt to demonstrate in a
        detailed, concrete fashion how seemingly innocuous design features in
        mass transit systems, water projects, industrial machinery, and other
        technologies actually mask social choices of profound significance.
        Historian David Noble has studied two kinds of automated machine tool
        systems that have different implications for the relative power of
        management and labor in the industries that might employ them. He has
        shown that although the basic electronic and mechanical components of
        the record/playback and numerical control systems are similar, the
        choice of one design over another has crucial consequences for social
        struggles on the shop floor. To see the matter solely in terms of cost
        cutting, efficiency, or the modernization of equipment is to miss a
        decisive element in the story.

      <p>
        From such examples I would offer some general conclusions. These
        correspond to the interpretation of technologies as &quot;forms of
        life&quot; presented in the previous chapter, filling in the explicitly
        political dimensions of that point of view.
      </p>

      <p>
        The things we call &quot;technologies&quot; are ways of building order
        in our world. Many technical devices and systems important in everyday
        life contain possibilities for many different ways of ordering human
        activity. Consciously or unconsciously, deliberately or inadvertently,
        societies choose structures for technologies that influence how people
        are going to work, communicate, travel, consume, and so forth over a
        very long time. In the processes by which structuring decisions are
        made, different people are situated differently and possess unequal
        degrees of power as well as unequal levels of awareness. By far the
        greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular
        instrument, system, or technique is introduced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment,
        economic investment, and social habit, the original flexibility vanishes
        for all practical purposes once the initial commitments are made. In
        that sense technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or
        political foundings that establish a framework for public order that
        will endure over many generations. For that reason the same careful
        attention one would give to the rules, roles, and relationships of
        politics must also be given to such things as the building of highways,
        the creation of television networks, and the tailoring of seemingly
        insignificant features on new machines. The issues that divide or unite
        people in society are settled not only in the institutions and practices
        of politics proper, but also, and less obviously, in tangible
        arrangements of steel and concrete, wires and semiconductors, nuts and
        bolts.
      </p>

      <h2>Inherently Political Technologies</h2>

      <p>
        NONE OF the arguments and examples considered thus far addresses a
        stronger, more troubling claim often made in writings about technology
        and society–the belief that some technologies are by their very nature
        political in a specific way. According to this view, the adoption of a
        given technical system unavoidably brings with it conditions for human
        relationships that have a distinctive political cast–for example,
        centralized or de-centralized, egalitarian or inegalitarian, repressive
        or liberating. This is ultimately what is at stake in assertions such as
        those of Lewis Mumford that two traditions of technology, one
        authoritarian, the other democratic, exist side-by-side in Western
        history. In all the cases cited above the technologies are relatively
        flexible in design and arrangement and variable in their effects.
        Although one can recognize a particular result produced in a particular
        setting, one can also easily imagine how a roughly similar device or
        system might have been built or situated with very much different
        political consequences. The idea we must now examine and evaluate is
        that certain kinds of technology do not allow such flexibility, and that
        to choose them is to choose unalterably a particular form of political
        life.
      </p>

      <p>
        A remarkably forceful statement of one version of this argument appears
        in Friedrich Engels' little essay &quot;On Authority&quot; written in
        1872. Answering anarchists who believed that authority is an evil that
        ought to be abolished altogether, Engels launches into a panegyric for
        authoritarianism, maintaining, among other things, that strong authority
        is a necessary condition in modern industry. To advance his case in the
        strongest possible way, he asks his readers to imagine that the
        revolution has already occurred. &quot;Supposing a social revolution
        dethroned the capitalists, who now exercise their authority over the
        production and circulation of wealth. Supposing, to adopt entirely the
        point of view of the antiauthoritarians, that the land and the
        instruments of labour had become the collective property of the workers
        who use them. Will authority have disappeared or will it have only
        changed its form?&quot;

        His answer draws upon lessons from three sociotechnical systems of his
        day, cotton-spinning mills, railways, and ships at sea. He observes that
        on its way to becoming finished thread, cotton moves through a number of
        different operations at different locations in the factory. The workers
        perform a wide variety of tasks, from running the steam engine to
        carrying the products from one room to another. Because these tasks must
        be coordinated and because the timing of the work is &quot;fixed by the
        authority of the steam,&quot; laborers must learn to accept a rigid
        discipline. They must, according to Engels, work at regular hours and
        agree to subordinate their individual wills to the persons in charge of
        factory operations. If they fail to do so, they risk the horrifying
        possibility that production will come to a grinding halt. Engels pulls
        no punches. &quot;The automatic machinery of a big factory,&quot; he
        writes, &quot;is much more despotic than the small capitalists who
        employ workers ever have been.&quot;<sup

      </p>

      <p>
        Similar lessons are adduced in Engels's analysis of the necessary
        operating conditions for railways and ships at sea. Both re quire the
        subordination of workers to an &quot;imperious authority&quot; that sees
        to it that things run according to plan. Engels finds that far from
        being an idiosyncrasy of capitalist social organization, relationships
        of authority and subordination arise &quot;independently of all social
        organization, and are imposed upon us together with the material
        conditions under which we produce and make products circulate.&quot;
        Again, he intends this to be stern advice to the anarchists who,
        according to Engels, thought it possible simply to eradicate
        subordination and superordination at a single stroke. All such schemes
        are nonsense. The roots of unavoidable authoritarianism are, he argues,
        deeply implanted in the human involvement with science and technology.
        &quot;If man, by dint of his knowledge and inventive genius, has subdued
        the forces of nature, the latter avenge themselves upon him by
        subjecting him, insofar as he employs them, to a veritable despotism
        independent of all social organization.<sup

      <p>
        Attempts to justify strong authority on the basis of supposedly
        necessary conditions of technical practice have an ancient history. A
        pivotal theme in the <em>Republic</em> is Plato's quest to borrow the
        authority of <em>technology</em> and employ it by analogy to buttress
        his argument in favor of authority in the state. Among the illustrations
        he chooses, like Engels, is that of a ship on the high seas. Because
        large sailing vessels by their very nature need to be steered with a
        firm hand, sailors must yield to their captain's commands; no reasonable
        person believes that ships can be run democratically. Plato goes on to
        suggest that governing a state is rather like being captain of a ship or
        like practicing medicine as a physician. Much the same conditions that
        require central rule and decisive action in organized technical activity
        also create this need in government.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Engels's argument, and arguments like it, the justification for
        authority is no longer made by Plato's classic analogy, but rather
        directly with reference to technology itself. If the basic case is as
        compelling as Engels believed it to be, one would expect that as a
        society adopted increasingly complicated technical systems as its
        material basis, the prospects for authoritarian ways of life would be
        greatly enhanced. Central control by knowledgeable people acting at the
        top of a rigid social hierarchy would seem increasingly prudent. In this
        respect his stand in &quot;On Authority&quot; appears to be at variance
        with Karl Marx's position in Volume I of <em>Capital.</em> Marx tries to
        show that increasing mechanization will render obsolete the hierarchical
        division of labor and the relationships of subordination that, in his
        view, were necessary during the early stages of modern manufacturing.
        &quot;Modern Industry,&quot; he writes, &quot;sweeps away by technical
        means the manufacturing division of labor, under which each man is bound
        hand and foot for life to a single detail operation. At the same time,
        the capitalistic form of that industry reproduces this same division of
        labour in a still more monstrous shape; in the factory proper, by
        converting the workman into a living appendage of the machine.&quot;
        <sup

        >
        In Marx's view the conditions that will eventually dissolve the
        capitalist division of labor and facilitate proletarian revolution are
        conditions latent in industrial technology itself The differences
        between Marx's position in <em>Capital</em> and Engels's in his essay
        raise an important question for socialism: What, after all, does modern
        technology make possible or necessary in political life? The theoretical
        tension we see here mirrors many troubles in the practice of freedom and
        authority that had muddied the tracks of socialist revolution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arguments to the effect that technologies are in some sense inherently
        political have been advanced in a wide variety of con texts, far too
        many to summarize here. My reading of such notions, however, reveals
        there are two basic ways of stating the case. One version claims that
        the adoption of a given technical system actually requires the creation
        and maintenance of a particular set of social conditions as the
        operating environment of that system. Engels's position is of this kind.
        A similar view is offered by a contemporary writer who holds that
        &quot;if you accept nuclear power plants, you also accept a
        techno-scientific industrial-military elite. Without these people in
        charge, you could not have nuclear power.&quot;<sup

        >
        In this conception some kinds of technology require their social
        environments to be structured in a particular way in much the same sense
        that an automobile requires wheels in order to move. The thing could not
        exist as an effective operating entity unless certain social as well as
        material conditions were met. The meaning of &quot;required&quot; here
        is that of practical (rather than logical) necessity—Thus, Plato thought
        it a practical necessity that a ship at sea have one captain and an
        unquestionably obedient crew.
      </p>

      <p>
        A second, somewhat weaker, version of the argument holds that a given
        kind of technology is strongly compatible with, but does not strictly
        require, social and political relationships of a particular stripe. Many
        advocates of solar energy have argued that technologies of that variety
        are more compatible with a democratic, egalitarian society than energy
        systems based on coal, oil, and nuclear power; at the same time they do
        not maintain that anything about solar energy requires democracy. Their
        case is, briefly, that solar energy is decentralizing in both a
        technical and political sense: technically speaking, it is vastly more
        reasonable to build solar systems in a disaggregated, widely distributed
        manner than in large-scale centralized plants; politically speaking,
        solar energy accommodates the attempts of individuals and local
        communities to manage their affairs effectively be cause they are
        dealing with systems that are more accessible, comprehensible, and
        controllable than huge centralized sources. In this view solar energy is
        desirable not only for its economic and environmental benefits, but also
        for the salutary institutions it is likely to permit in other areas of
        public life.

      </p>

      <p>
        Within both versions of the argument there is a further distinction to
        be made between conditions that are internal to the workings of a given
        technical system and those that are external to it. Engels's thesis
        concerns internal social relations said to be required within cotton
        factories and railways, for example; what such relationships mean for
        the condition of society at large is, for him, a separate question. In
        contrast, the solar advocate's belief that solar technologies are
        compatible with democracy pertains to the way they complement aspects of
        society removed from the organization of those technologies as such.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are, then, several different directions that arguments of this
        kind can follow. Are the social conditions predicated said to be
        required by, or strongly compatible with, the workings of a given
        technical system? Are those conditions internal to that system or
        external to it (or both)? Although writings that address such questions
        are often unclear about what is being asserted, arguments in this
        general category are an important part of modern political discourse.
        They enter into many attempts to explain how changes in social life take
        place in the wake of technological innovation. More important, they are
        often used to buttress attempts to justify or criticize proposed courses
        of action involving new technology. By offering distinctly political
        reasons for or against the adoption of a particular technology,
        arguments of this kind stand apart from more commonly employed, more
        easily quantifiable claims about economic costs and benefits,
        environmental impacts, and possible risks to public health and safety
        that technical systems may involve. The issue here does not concern how
        many jobs will be created, how much income generated, how many
        pollutants added, or how many cancers produced. Rather, the issue has to
        do with ways in which choices about technology have important
        consequences for the form and quality of human associations.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we examine social patterns that characterize the environments of
        technical systems, we find certain devices and systems almost invariably
        linked to specific ways of organizing power and authority. The important
        question is: Does this state of affairs derive from an unavoidable
        social response to intractable properties in the things themselves, or
        is it instead a pattern imposed independently by a governing body,
        ruling class, or some other social or cultural institution to further
        its own purposes?
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking the most obvious example, the atom bomb is an inherently
        political artifact. As long as it exists at all, its lethal properties
        demand that it be controlled by a centralized, rigidly hierarchical
        chain of command closed to all influences that might make its workings
        unpredictable. The internal social system of the bomb must be
        authoritarian; there is no other way. The state of affairs stands as a
        practical necessity independent of any larger political system in which
        the bomb is embedded, independent of the type of regime or character of
        its rulers. Indeed, democratic states must try to find ways to ensure
        that the social structures and mentality that characterize the
        management of nuclear weapons do not &quot;spin off&quot; or &quot;spill
        over&quot; into the polity as a whole.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bomb is, of course, a special case. The reasons very rigid
        relationships of authority are necessary in its immediate presence
        should be clear to anyone. If, however, we look for other instances in
        which particular varieties of technology are widely perceived to need
        the maintenance of a special pattern of power and authority, modern
        technical history contains a wealth of examples.

        Alfred D. Chandler in <em>The Visible Hand,</em> a monumental study of
        modern business enterprise, presents impressive documentation to defend
        the hypothesis that the construction and day-to day operation of many
        systems of production, transportation, and communication in the
        nineteenth and twentieth centuries require the development of particular
        social form–a large-scale centralized, hierarchical organization
        administered by highly skilled managers. Typical of Chandler's reasoning
        is his analysis of the growth of the railroads.<sup

          Technology made possible fast, all-weather transportation; but safe,
          regular, reliable movement of goods and passengers, as well as the
          continuing maintenance and repair of locomotives, rolling stock, and
          track, roadbed, stations, roundhouses, and other equipment, required
          the creation of a sizable administrative organization. It meant the
          employment of a set of managers to supervise these functional
          activities over an extensive geographical area; and the appointment of
          an administrative command of middle and top executives to monitor,
          evaluate, and coordinate the work of managers responsible for the
          day-to-day operations.

      <p>
        Throughout his book Chandler points to ways in which technologies used
        in the production and distribution of electricity, chemicals, and a wide
        range of industrial goods &quot;demanded&quot; or &quot;required&quot;
        this form of human association. &quot;Hence, the operational
        requirements of railroads demanded the creation of the first
        administrative hierarchies in American business.&quot;

        Were there other conceivable ways of organizing these aggregates of
        people and apparatus? Chandler shows that a previously dominant social
        form, the small traditional family firm, simply could not handle the
        task in most cases. Although he does not speculate further, it is clear
        that he believes there is, to be realistic, very little latitude in the
        forms of power and authority appropriate within modern sociotechnical
        systems. The properties of many modern technologies—oil pipelines and
        refineries, for example—are such that overwhelmingly impressive
        economies of scale and speed are possible. If such such systems are to
        work effectively, efficiently, quickly, and safely, certain requirements
        of internal social organization have to be fulfilled; the material
        possibilites that modern technologies make available could not be
        explotited otherwise. Chandler acknolwedges that as one compares
        sociotechnical institutions of different nations, one sees &quot;ways in
        which cultural attitudes, values, ideologies, political systems, and
        social structure affect these imperatives.&quot;

        But the weight of argument and empirical evidence in
        <em>The Visible Hand</em> suggests that any significant departure from
        the basic pattern would be, at best, highly unlikely.
      </p>

      <p>
        It may be that other conceivable arrangements of power and authority,
        for example, those of decentralized, democratic worker self-management,
        could prove capable of administering factories, refineries,
        communications systems, and railroads as well as or better than the
        organizations Chandler describes. Evidence from automobile assembly
        teams in Sweden and worker- managed plants in Yugoslavia and other
        countries is often presented to salvage these possibilities. Unable to
        settle controversies over this matter here, I merely point to what I
        consider to be their bone of contention. The available evidence tends to
        show that many large, sophisticated technological systems are in fact
        highly compatible with centralized, hierarchical managerial control. The
        interesting question, however, has to do with whether or not this
        pattern is in any sense a requirement of such systems, a question that
        is not solely empirical. The matter ultimately rests on our judgments
        about what steps, if any, are practically necessary in the workings of
        particular kinds of technology and what, if anything, such measures
        require of the structure of human associations. Was Plato right in
        saying that a ship at sea needs steering by a decisive hand and that
        this could only be accomplished by a single captain and an obedient
        crew? Is Chandler correct in saying that the properties of large-scale
        systems require centralized, hierarchical managerial control?
      </p>

      <p>
        To answer such questions, we would have to examine in some detail the
        moral claims of practical necessity (including those advocated in the
        doctrines of economics) and weigh them against moral claims of other
        sorts, for example, the notion that it is good for sailors to
        participate in the command of a ship or that workers have a right to be
        involved in making and administering decisions in a factory. It is
        characteristic of societies based on large, complex technological
        systems, however, that moral reasons other than those of practical
        necessity appear increasingly obsolete, &quot;idealistic,&quot; and
        irrelevant. Whatever claims one may wish to make on behalf of liberty,
        justice, or equality can be immediately neutralized when confronted with
        arguments to the effect, &quot;Fine, but that's no way to run a
        railroad&quot; (or steel mill, or airline, or communication system, and
        so on). Here we en counter an important quality in modern political
        discourse and in the way people commonly think about what measures are
        justified in response to the possibilities technologies make available.
        In many instances, to say that some technologies are inherently
        political is to say that certain widely accepted reasons of practical
        necessity–especially the need to maintain crucial technological systems
        as smoothly working entities–have tended to eclipse other sorts of moral
        and political reasoning.
      </p>

      <p>
        One attempt to salvage the autonomy of politics from the bind of
        practical necessity involves the notion that conditions of human
        association found in the internal workings of technological systems can
        easily be kept separate from the polity as a whole. Americans have long
        rested content in the belief that arrangements of power and authority
        inside industrial corporations, public utilities, and the like have
        little bearing on public institutions, practices, and ideas at large.
        That &quot;democracy stops at the factory gates&quot; was taken as a
        fact of life that had nothing to do with the practice of political
        freedom. But can the internal politics of technology and the politics of
        the whole community be so easily separated? A recent study of business
        leaders in the United States, contemporary exemplars of Chandler's
        &quot;visible hand of management,&quot; found them remark ably impatient
        with such democratic scruples as &quot;one man one vote. If democracy
        doesn't work for the firm, the most critical institution in all of
        society, American executives ask, how well can it be expected to work
        for the government of a nation–particularly when that government
        attempts to interfere with the achievements of the firm? The authors of
        the report observe that patterns of authority that work effectively in
        the corporation be come for businessmen &quot;the desirable model
        against which to compare political and economic relationships in the
        rest of society.&quot;<sup

        While such findings are far from conclusive, they do reflect a sentiment
        increasingly common in the land: what dilemmas such as the energy crisis
        require is not a redistribution of wealth or broader public
        participation but, rather, stronger, centralized public and private
        management.
      </p>

      <p>
        An especially vivid case in which the operational requirements of a
        technical system might influence the quality of public life is the
        debates about the risks of nuclear power. As the supply of uranium for
        nuclear reactors runs out, a proposed alternative fuel is the plutonium
        generated as a byproduct in reactor cores. Well-known objections to
        plutonium recycling focus on its unacceptable economic costs, its risks
        of environmental contamination, and its dangers in regard to the
        international proliferation of nuclear weapons. Beyond these concerns,
        however stands another less widely appreciated set of hazards–those that
        involve the sacrifice of civil liberties. The widespread use of
        plutonium as a fuel increases the chance that this toxic substance might
        be stolen by terrorists, organized crime, or other persons. This raises
        the prospect, and not a trivial one, that extraordinary measures would
        have to be taken to safeguard plutonium from theft and to recover it
        should the substance be stolen. Workers in the nuclear industry as well
        as ordinary citizens outside could well become subject to background
        security checks, covert surveillance, wiretapping, informers, and even
        emergency measures under martial law–all justified by the need to
        safeguard plutonium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Russell W. Ayres's study of the legal ramifications of plutonium
        recycling concludes: &quot;With the passage of time and the increase in
        the quantity of plutonium in existence will come pressure to eliminate
        the traditional checks the courts and legislatures place on the
        activities of the executive and to develop a powerful central authority
        better able to enforce strict safeguards.&quot; He avers that &quot;once
        a quantity of plutonium had been stolen, the case for literally turning
        the country upside down to get it back would be overwhelming.&quot;
        Ayres anticipates and worries about the kinds of thinking that, I have
        argued, characterize inherently political technologies. It is still true
        that in a world in which human beings make and maintain artificial
        systems nothing is &quot;required&quot; in an absolute sense.
        Nevertheless, once a course of action is under way, once artifacts such
        as nuclear power plants have been built and put in operation, the kinds
        of reasoning that justify the adaptation of social life to technical
        requirements pop up as spontaneously as flowers in the spring. In
        Ayres's words, &quot;Once recycling begins and the risks of plutonium
        theft become real rather than hypothetical, the case for governmental
        infringement of protected rights will seem compelling.&quot;<sup

        The two varieties of interpretation I have outlined indicate how
        artifacts can have political qualities. In the first instance we noticed
        ways in which specific features in the design or arrangement of a device
        or system could provide a convenient means of establishing patterns of
        power and authority in a given setting. Technologies of this kind have a
        range of flexibility in the dimensions of their material form. It is
        precisely because they are flexible that their consequences for society
        must be understood with reference to the social actors able to influence
        which de signs and arrangements are chosen. In the second instance we
        examined ways in which the intractable properties of certain kinds of
        technology are strongly, perhaps unavoidably, linked to particular
        institutionalized patterns of power and authority. Here the initial
        choice about whether or not to adopt something is decisive in regard to
        its consequences. There are no alternative physical designs or
        arrangements that would make a significant difference; there are,
        furthermore, no genuine possibilities for creative intervention by
        different social systems–capitalist or socialist–that could change the
        intractability of the entity or significantly alter the quality of its
        political effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        To know which variety of interpretation is applicable in a given case is
        often what is at stake in disputes, some of them passionate ones, about
        the meaning of technology for how we live. I have argued a
        &quot;both/and&quot; position here, for it seems to me that both kinds
        of understanding are applicable in different circumstances. Indeed, it
        can happen that within a particular complex of technology–a system of
        communication or transportation, for example–some aspects may be
        flexible in their possibilities for society, while other aspects may be
        (for better or worse) completely intractable. The two varieties of
        interpretation I have examined here can overlap and intersect at many
        points.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are, of course, issues on which people can disagree. Thus, some
        proponents of energy from renewable resources now believe they have at
        last discovered a set of intrinsically democratic, egalitarian,
        communitarian technologies. In my best estimation, however, the social
        consequences of building renewable energy systems will surely depend on
        the specific configurations of both hardware and the social institutions
        created to bring that energy to us. It may be that we will find ways to
        turn this silk purse into a sow's ear. By comparison, advocates of the
        further development of nuclear power seem to believe that they are
        working on a rather flexible technology whose adverse social effects can
        be fixed by changing the design parameters of reactors and nuclear waste
        disposal systems. For reasons indicated above, I believe them to be dead
        wrong in that faith. Yes, we may be able to manage some of the
        &quot;risks&quot; to public health and safety that nuclear power brings.
        But as society adapts to the more dangerous and apparently indelible
        features of nuclear power, what will be the long-range toll in human
        freedom?
      </p>

      <p>
        My belief that we ought to attend more closely to technical objects
        themselves is not to say that we can ignore the contexts in which those
        objects are situated. A ship at sea may well re quire, as Plato and
        Engels insisted, a single captain and obedient crew. But a ship out of
        service, parked at the dock, needs only a caretaker. To understand which
        technologies and which con texts are important to us, and why, is an
        enterprise that must involve both the study of specific technical
        systems and their history as well as a thorough grasp of the concepts
        and controversies of political theory. In our times people are often
        willing to make drastic changes in the way they live to accommodate
        technological innovation while at the same time resisting similar kinds
        of changes justified on political grounds. If for no other reason than
        that, it is important for us to achieve a clearer view of these matters
        than has been our habit so far.

                Wood Energy in Canada (Toronto: Renewable Energy in Canada,
                1978). &quot;We think decentralization is an implicit component
                of renewable energy; this implies the de centralization of
                energy systems, communities and of power. Renewable energy
                doesn't require mammoth generation sources of disruptive
                transmission corridors. Our cities and towns, which have been
                dependent on centralized energy supplies, may be able to achieve
                some degree of autonomy, thereby controlling and administering
                their own energy needs.&quot; (16)
