			<h2>Preface Being Post-Internet</h2>
			<p>This PDF is to serve as an extended statement of artistic purpose and critique of our contemporary relation to
				objects and images in Post-Internet culture. More than anything, it poses a survey of contemplations and open
				questions on contemporary art and culture after the Internet.</p>
			<p>“Post-Internet Art” is a term coined by artist Marisa Olson<sup><a href="#fn1-14200" id="fnr1-14200"
						title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and developed further by writer Gene McHugh in the
				critical
				blog “Post Internet”<sup><a href="#fn2-14200" id="fnr2-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
				during its activity between December 2009 and September 2010. Under McHugh’s definition it concerns “art
				responding
				to [a condition] described as ‘Post Internet’–when the Internet is less a novelty and more a banality. Perhaps
				...
				closer to what Guthrie Lonergan described as ‘Internet Aware’–or when the photo of the art object is more widely
				dispersed [&amp;] viewed than the object itself.” There are also several references to the idea of “post-net
				culture” in the writings of Lev Manovich as early as 2001.<sup><a href="#fn3-14200" id="fnr3-14200"
						title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Specifically within the context of this PDF, Post-Internet
				is
				defined as a result of the contemporary moment: inherently informed by ubiquitous authorship, the development of
				attention as currency, the collapse of physical space in networked culture, and the infinite reproducibility and
				mutability of digital materials. Post-Internet also serves as an important semantic distinction from the two
				historical artistic modes with which it is most often associated: New Media Art and Conceptualism. New Media is
				here
				denounced as a mode too narrowly focused on the specific workings of novel technologies, rather than a sincere
				exploration of cultural shifts in which that technology plays only a small role. It can therefore be seen as
				relying
				too heavily on the specific materiality of its media. Conceptualism (in theory if not practice) presumes a lack
				of
				attention to the physical substrate in favor of the methods of disseminating the artwork as idea, image,
				context,
				or
				instruction.</p>
			<p>Post-Internet art instead exists somewhere between these two poles. Post-Internet objects and images are
				developed
				with concern to their particular materiality as well as their vast variety of methods of presentation and
				dissemination. It is important to also note that “being Post-Internet” is a distinction which carries
				ramifications
				beyond the art context as a societal condition at large, and that it would be antithetical to attempt to
				pinpoint
				any discrete moment at which the Post-Internet period begins. Any cultural production which has been influenced
				by
				a
				network ideology falls under the rubric of Post-Internet. The term is therefore not discretely tied to a certain
				event, though it could be argued that the bulk of the cultural shifts described herein come with the
				introduction
				of
				privately-run commercial Internet service providers and the availability of personal computers.</p>

			<p>Art is a social object.</p>
			<p>From the rise of a liberal market economy through the build-up and ubiquity of the “middle class,” art has
				matched
				and excused itself with the social conditions of its production. The rise of the “industrialized arts” gave way
				to
				lofty notions of art-after-object as late capitalism approached, all the while explaining itself as obligated to
				echo existing cultural conditions rather than move to shape them.</p>
			<p>Where are we left now? Art and arts pedagogy has become so inextricably linked with a variety of
				interpretations
				on
				the Conceptual art doxa that it would be impossible to argue <em>against</em> any artistic gesture being
				automatically tied to its reception and the language surrounding it. At least from a historical perspective,
				Conceptual art assured its own legacy by the overwhelming volume of language produced within and around it at a
				time
				when summary-throughlanguage was the easiest means of disseminating an object (profoundly simpler, even, than
				reproducing a photograph).</p>
			<p>We find ourselves in radically different times. Increasingly the majority of both our cultural reception and
				production is mediated through some descendant of a Turing machine—taken now both technically and culturally for
				Turing’s “universal machine,” a “single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence.”<sup><a
						href="#fn4-14200" id="fnr4-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup> In cultural terms,
				assuming
				a certain level of access which does not yet exist in all cases,<sup><a href="#fn5-14200" id="fnr5-14200"
						title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup> the ubiquity of these devices and their massively
				interconnected nature signifies two realities which are crucial to an understanding of art after the Internet.
			</p>
			<p>First, nothing is in a fixed state: i.e., <em>everything is anything else</em>, whether because any object is
				capable of becoming another type of object or because an object already exists in flux between multiple
				instantiations. The latter is a schema already intuitively arrived at by artists in recent history, prompting
				writers as diverse as Rosalind Krauss and Lev Manovich to proclaim a “Post-Medium Condition”<sup><a
						href="#fn6-14200" id="fnr6-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup> and the rise of
				“Post-Media
				Aesthetics”<sup><a href="#fn7-14200" id="fnr7-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup> (Krauss
				using
				it as a vessel to decry art marooned in medium specificity, what she calls “technical support;&quot; Manovich
				uses
				it to offer a sketch of how one might categorize different types of art in an environment without traditional
				notions of “medium”).</p>
			<p>The former, an art object’s lack of fixity in representational strategy, is less often explored. This is not to
				say
				that artists are not involved in exploring the relationship of many copies and variations of a single object to
				one
				another. Artists like Oliver Laric and Seth Price routinely present multiple variations of the same
				object—Laric’s
				<em>Versions</em> exists as “a series of sculptures, airbrushed images of missiles, a talk, a PDF, a song, a
				novel,
				a recipe, a play, a dance routine, a feature film and merchandise,”<sup><a href="#fn8-14200" id="fnr8-14200"
						title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Price’s <em>Dispersion</em> &quot;[taking] the form of a
				widely reproduced essay, an artists’ book, a freely available online PDF, as well as [a] sculpture.”<sup><a
						href="#fn9-14200" id="fnr9-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> These works are
				emblematic
				as Post-Internet gestures and have surely been influential in different ways, but step only lightly away from
				the
				tautological rationale of Conceptual art (typified in Joseph Kosuth’s 1965 <em>One and Three Chairs</em>, an
				arrangement of three versions of the same object, each signifying “chair,” and language surrounding the piece to
				assert that nothing is being missed and the art is in the idea—Kosuth’s “Art as Idea as Idea”).
			</p>
			<p>In the Post-Internet climate, it is assumed that the work of art lies equally in the version of the object one
				would encounter at a gallery or museum, the images and other representations disseminated through the Internet
				and
				print publications, bootleg images of the object or its representations, and variations on any of these as
				edited
				and recontextualized by any other author. The less developed stratagem for pointing to a lack of
				representational
				fixity is that of taking an object to be represented (to be more direct, <em>presented</em>) as another type of
				object entirely, without reference to the “original.” For objects after the Internet there can be no “original
				copy.” Even if an image or object is able to be traced back to a source, the substance (substance in the sense
				of
				both its materiality and its importance) of the source object can no longer be regarded as inherently greater
				than
				any of its copies. When I take a moving image and represent it through an object (video rendered sculpturally in
				styrofoam for example), I am positing an alternative method of representation without ever supplying a way to
				view
				the source. A source video exists. The idea of a source video exists. But the way the object is instantiated
				denies
				both the necessity of an original and adherence to the representational norms that follow the creation of
				“video”
				as
				both technical device and terminology.</p>
			<p>The possibilities for these transformations, alternative methods of viewing “media” which essentially amounts
				to
				an
				arbitrary assemblage of data, has thus far been most thoroughly examined in the field of “information
				aesthetics,”
				a
				field as distanced from Post-Internet art as it is close to design, cartography, and indexing. Its fault is in
				its
				attempt to encapsulate large amounts of data—practical information, experience—into an aesthetic and
				understandable
				shorthand. In other words, information aesthetics provides in one object both a representation and the
				components
				which make up its source in an attempt to illustrate or arrive at knowledge. While Conceptualism as outlined by
				Kosuth may be limiting in its reliance on art propositions as enclosed tautological systems, its
				foundationsdelineating progressive art with the same zeal Greenberg applied to ascribing modernism its
				“purity”<sup><a href="#fn10-14200" id="fnr10-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup>—hold
				true:
				“art’s viability is not connected to the presentation of visual (or other) kinds of experience.”<sup><a
						href="#fn11-14200" id="fnr11-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a></sup> For us to receive a
				piece
				of art and determine from it some piece of empirical information about the world at large would seem almost a
				bewildering proposition, even in a cultural climate where we have accepted that the singular qualification for
				the
				moniker “art” is the intention of any one individual to label it as such.</p>

			<p>The second aspect of art after the Internet deals with not the nature of the art object but the nature of its
				reception and social presence. To be “progressive” in art is a fundamental impulse which which seems to pervade
				the
				majority of our judgements of the quality of art propositions. This leads to the use of such terms as the
				“avant-garde,” which in the twentieth century held as its central project the delineation of a cultural space
				for
				art to occupy in relation to “mass media.” However the nature of mass media is now profoundly different, in that
				we
				are both its subject and the engine behind it. Attention has always been a currency, but with the proliferation
				of
				networking methods and infinitely alterable and reproducible media, that attention has diverged and become split
				amongst anyone and everyone who wishes to</p>
			<p>seek it. Fixed (which is to say, physical) media once imposed an economy to the image and object, a value
				driven
				by
				scarcity which necessitated a one-to-many system of distribution. Over time this spread and democratization of
				image
				and object production tools has led to a perpetual iconoclasm, each successive volley of formats breeding a new
				dogma and its own particular set of aesthetic principles. Hyperreal tableau photography gives way to the
				fetishized
				imperfection of the polaroid, tape hiss is abandoned for ironic autotuning, &amp;c. What has remained through
				each
				iconoclasm is an inability to fully break the mentality imposed by a one-to-many system of distribution. The
				continual use of “They” in language: “They should make a second one, They should have done it this way, They
				should
				stop doing this,” &amp;c., can be seen as sort of philosophical litmus test in which our method of discussing
				cultural production continually falls short. “They” implies an alienation from production, a continuous deferral
				to
				action. It is a vacant critique, either proposal for the perpetuation of the same image unchanged (“They should
				release this on another platform”) or proposal for an iconoclasm which will never take place, the genesis of the
				proposition being encased entirely in a passive mode of reception. This deferral is an act which accepts dogma,
				accepts a dominant image paradigm as an unchanging absolute rather than the result of a complicated history of
				new
				approaches. “They” venerates this absoluteness, sanctifies it, while its opposite, “We,” postures towards the
				creation of an alternative and constitutes an actual schism; Baudrillard writes: “One can see that the
				iconoclasts,
				whom one accuses of disdaining and negating images, were those who accorded them their true value, in contrast
				to
				the iconolaters who only saw reflections in them and were content to venerate a filigree God.”<sup><a
						href="#fn12-14200" id="fnr12-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/5_image_0.png" alt="images/5_image_0.png" />
				<figcaption>Open questions.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The use of “We” is not to advocate solely for participatory structures of art but to insist on a participatory
				view
				of culture at large, and ultimately of taking iconoclasm itself as a quotidian activity. Whereas in previous
				times
				it was legitimate to conceive of culture as a greater system with impassible barriers to entry and a finitude of
				possibilities, culture after the Internet offers a radically different paradigm which our “They” idiom does not
				allow for. This is not to say that we have entered a fully utopian age of endless possibilities but simply to
				claim
				that culture and language are fundamentally changed by the ability for anyone to gain free access to the same
				image-creation tools used by mass-media workers, utilize the same or better structures to disseminate those
				images,
				and gain free access to the majority of canonical writings and concepts offered by institutions of higher
				learning.<sup><a href="#fn13-14200" id="fnr13-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>
			<p>These are conditions endemic to Post-Internet society, allowing for a ubiquitous authorship which challenges
				notions of the “definitive history” or the “original copy.” Just as Barthes’ proclamation of the “death of the
				author” is in fact a celebration of the “birth of the reader” and the “overthrow[ing of] the myth,”<sup><a
						href="#fn14-14200" id="fnr14-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">14</a></sup> culture Post-Internet
				is
				made up of reader-authors who by necessity must regard all cultural output as an idea or work in progress able
				to
				be
				taken up and continued by any of its viewers.</p>
			<p>With this comes new issues, though. As Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker point out, “the mere existence of
				networks does not imply democracy or equality … [we] suggest [that] rhizomatics and distribution signal a new
				management style … as real as pyramidal hierarchy, corporate bureaucracy, [&amp;c.].”<sup><a href="#fn15-14200"
						id="fnr15-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>
			<p>While art may no longer have to contend with an idea of “mass media” as a fixed, monolithic system, instead it
				must
				now deal with both itself and culture at large as a constellation of diverging communities, each fixated on
				propagating and preserving itself. This condition is espoused in the writings of Nicolas Bourriaud as
				“constructing
				archipelagoes … a voluntary grouping of islands networked together to create autonomous entities” as a means of
				proclaiming that “the universalist and progressive dream that governed modern times is in tatters.”<sup><a
						href="#fn16-14200" id="fnr16-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Elsewhere Critical
				Art
				Ensemble (CAE) explain similar ideas, expressing culture as already beholden to a “bunker” ideology, a
				self-preserving and replicating tendency towards the formation of specified bureaucratic structures, a tendency
				CAE
				pinpoints equally in “community-based art”<sup><a href="#fn17-14200" id="fnr17-14200" title="see footnote"
						class="footnote">17</a></sup> and traditional mass media. CAE write, “While mass media brings its viewer the
				world, the world is also held at bay while the viewer commits h/er gaze to the screen, forever separated from
				others
				and from communal space”<sup><a href="#fn18-14200" id="fnr18-14200" title="see footnote"
						class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>
			<p>Increasingly though, mass media and the world of “the screen” is our communal space. And with it comes new
				fragments with their own particular hierarchies. As reader-authors navigating these fragments, where now would
				we
				find a space within which to delineate “art“? Or, if the new “mass media” is as distributed and varied as our
				social
				networks themselves, and in fact driven by them, is that delineation even necessary? Ironically, the most
				radical
				and “progressive” movements of the Post-Internet period would be those who either pass by either largely
				unnoticed
				due to a decision to opt out of any easily-accessible distribution networks, or else would be composed of a
				community of people producing cultural objects not intended as artistic propositions and not applying themselves
				with the label of artist.<sup><a href="#fn19-14200" id="fnr19-14200" title="see footnote"

		<section>
			<p>The “bunker” of art and artist persists, however. The goal of some Post-Internet practices is to engage with
				this
				proliferation of images and objects—“general web content,”<sup><a href="#fn20-14200" id="fnr20-14200"
						title="see footnote" class="footnote">20</a></sup> items of culture created without necessarily being
				described
				as art—and proclaim an authorial stance by indexing / curating these objects. These projects are as wide-ranging
				as
				Jon Rafman’s “Nine Eyes of Google Street View” project<sup><a href="#fn21-14200" id="fnr21-14200"
						title="see footnote" class="footnote">21</a></sup> and some of the earlier works done by Surf Clubs<sup><a
						href="#fn22-14200" id="fnr22-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">22</a></sup> and their
				participants,
				among them Guthrie Lonergan who was one of the first artists to release works in the form of YouTube playlists.
				Artists after the Internet thus take on a role more closely aligned to that of the interpreter, transcriber,
				narrator, curator, architect.</p>
			<p>This is often broadly ascribed to traditions of artists dealing with the banal, the everyday: “surfing as art”
				articulating quotidian Internet-user “tactics”<sup><a href="#fn23-14200" id="fnr23-14200" title="see footnote"
						class="footnote">23</a></sup> or the artists acting, essentially, as ethnographers who would chart and
				explain
				the new variety of images found within visual culture.<sup><a href="#fn24-14200" id="fnr24-14200"
						title="see footnote" class="footnote">24</a></sup> I would argue for a slightly different case.</p>
			<p>In his essay <em>On the New</em>, Boris Groys writes:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>… art can [become unusual, surprising, &amp;c.] only by tapping into classical, mythological, and religious
					traditions and breaking its connection with the banality of everyday experience. The successful (and
					deservedly
					so) mass cultural image production of our age concerns itself with attacks by aliens, myths of apocalypse and
					redemption, heroes endowed with superhuman powers, and so forth. All of this is certainly fascinating and
					instructive. Once in a while, though, one would like to be able to contemplate and enjoy something normal,
					something ordinary, something banal as well. … In life, on the other hand, only the extraordinary is presented
					to
					us as a possible object of our admiration.<sup><a href="#fn25-14200" id="fnr25-14200" title="see footnote"
							class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>But just as any object is conceivably any other object, our ubiquitous authorship marks a point in cultural
				production at which the extraordinary is now also the ordinary—the myth is also the everyday. In many of my
				video
				works, I make a point to appropriate imagery from recent popular films, mass media spectacles made with all of
				the
				fervor and resolution of an empire that only partially realizes its own decay. The striking thing about these
				images
				is not their content but their availability and the context within which they are now received. Where once an
				experience of cinema was that of receiving an absolute, fixed icon—a definitive copy, inaccessible and
				precious—that
				is now far from the case. Cinema now becomes encapsulated, transferrable and transformable in the same vain as
				everything else, a “file” to be treated with all the levity we reserve for any other file.</p>
			<p>The images I deal with in my work, authentic unauthorized copies of spectacle films, thus represent the
				absolute
				collapse of the mythological and the quotidian into a single indistinguishable whole. The goal of organizing
				appropriated cultural objects after the Internet cannot be simply to act as a didactic ethnographer but to
				present
				microcosms and create propositions for arrangements or representational strategies which have not yet been fully
				developed. Taking a didactic stance amounts to perpetuating a state of affairs of art positioned in
				contradiction
				to
				an older one-to-many hierarchy of mass media. For the new hierarchies of many-tomany production, the cultural
				status
				of objects is now influenced entirely by the attention given to them, the way they are transmitted socially and
				the
				variety of communities they come to inhabit.</p>
			<p>Thus in the same way that all cultural images and objects become general—the film <em>Independence Day</em>
				being
				not dissimilar in homogeneity and degree of spectacle from any individual’s photos of their newborn child on
				Facebook —so too does the authorial stance of the artist become general. Any sorting of images or aspects of
				culture, applied with a declaration or narrative gesture, becomes not dissimilar to our experience of everyday
				life,
				regardless of the degree to which the images are spectacular. What comes to matter is not that an artist has
				presented some aspect of the spectacle and how it fits neatly into some aspect of a linear historical
				trajectory.
				What matters is that in the presentation they have created a proposition towards an alternate conception of
				cultural
				objects.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>If, in Post-Internet culture, artistic production must deal with arrangements and representations of images and
				objects taken from any cultural context, how do we conceive of sorting the artists themselves? How do we judge
				the
				spaces in which this work is exhibited, on the Internet and off?</p>
			<p>As Lauren Christiansen writes, “with today’s burgeoning potential for digital mass viewership, transmission
				becomes
				as important as creation. Contemporary online artists are aware of this fact and seek to actively make use of
				its
				potential.”<sup><a href="#fn26-14200" id="fnr26-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">26</a></sup> As
				artists
				come to self-sort and form international communities based on mutual investigations, it is absurd to think of
				being
				able to act with any curatorial agency in selecting from the vast array of “contemporary artists” without being
				in
				some way tied directly to those artists’ social networks. The methods of transmission these artists use become
				imbricated with the work they create, who accesses it, and the spaces they ultimately show in.</p>
			<p>This is a complicated turn, as communities are for the moment more likely to form based on aesthetic principles
				than conceptual or ideological ones. Whether these aesthetic principles mean a preference for sleek geometric
				shapes
				with gradient overlays or mean a preference for a particular blogging platform, the underlying segmentation is
				the
				same. Posting an image of a gradient implicates an artist within a particular aesthetic mindset in the same way
				that
				having a Tumblr adheres an artist to a particular format of transmission. In either case, the architecture of
				the
				Internet—an arrangement of language, sound, and images in which imagery is the most dominant, immediate
				factor—helps
				facilitate an environment where artists are able to rely more and more on purely visual representations to
				convey
				their ideas and support an explanation of their art independent of language. This is a crucial point of
				departure
				from recent art history, as arguably it marks an abandonment of language and semiotics as base metaphors for
				articulating works of art and our relationship to objects and culture.<sup><a href="#fn27-14200"
						id="fnr27-14200" title="see footnote" class="footnote">27</a></sup></p>
			<p>This should come as little surprise as, especially after the Internet, the far more instantaneous and safe
				method
				of communication is through imagery. Dealing with language can too forcibly illustrate the thoughts behind an
				image,
				or belittle a work if the text is not as clever or aesthetic as the image itself. Language can also be
				excruciatingly limiting for those who trained to think beyond the fixity of “mediums,” especially as the
				involvement
				of language in most average Internet use comes down to having a keen memory for appropriate search terms,
				keywords,
				tags: a simple but nevertheless grossly limiting architecture.</p>
			<p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/9_image_0.png" alt="images/9_image_0.png" />
				<figcaption>Deprecated tags</figcaption>
			</figure>
			</p>
			<p>Further, it marks a denigration of objects and our relationship to space: if an object before us in a gallery
				is
				only one of an infinite multitude of possible forms that object could take, its value to the viewer becomes
				little
				more than a curiosity. The viewer can judge it only by visually and conceptually relating it to every other
				project
				they are aware of by said artist and the other artists within their aesthetic community.</p>
			<p>The strategy employed by myself and others towards this physical relationship has been to create projects which
				move seamlessly from physical representation to Internet representation, either changing for each context, built
				with an intention of universality, or created with a deliberate irreverence for either venue of transmission. In
				any
				case, the representation through image, rigorously controlled and edited for ideal viewing angle and conditions,
				almost always becomes the central focus. It is a constellation of formal-aesthetic quotations, self-aware of its
				art
				context and built to be shared and cited. It becomes the image object itself.</p>
